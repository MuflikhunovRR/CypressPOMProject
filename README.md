# Cypress Page Object Model

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Page Object Model (POM) with Cypress for automated testing of web applications. The POM design pattern separates test code from the code that interacts with web elements, enhancing maintainability and reusability.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run Cypress tests locally.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/MuflikhunovRR/CypressPOMProject.git
cd cypress-pom-tutorial


2. Install project dependencies:

npm install


## Running Tests

To execute Cypress tests, use the following command:

npm test


Cypress will open a test runner where you can select and run individual test cases or the entire suite.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `cypress/`: Contains Cypress test files and configuration.
- `cypress/integration/`: Cypress test specs.
- `pageObjects/`: Page Object Model classes for interacting with web elements.
- `pageElements/`: JSON files containing element locators.
- `cypress.json`: Cypress configuration file.

## Writing Tests

You can create new test cases by adding `.spec.js` files to the `cypress/integration/` directory. To follow the Page Object Model, create or update Page Object classes in the `pageObjects/` directory.

## Built With

- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) - End-to-end testing framework for web applications.
